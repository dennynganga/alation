# Python Dependency Sorter
## Running locally
To run this project locally, first create a virtualenv: `python -m venv alation`. Then change directory into the created environment: `cd alation` and clone this repo.
Activate the virtualenv: `. bin/activate`. To see the code run, you can change into the directory that was just cloned: `cd alation` and 
run `python sort_dependencies.py` and that will print out the output (currently the input is hardcoded but you can change it to whatever you want https://github.com/dennynganga/alation/blob/e2ae49e7b65b16043aa48da9ebcc03b1ce4eed70/sort_dependencies.py#L34)
